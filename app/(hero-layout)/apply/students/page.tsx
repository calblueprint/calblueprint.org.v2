            Each semester, we are unfortunately only able to move forward a
            select number of applicants. This is both so that every member of
            our project teams may develop close relationships with our nonprofit
            and community partners and so that we are internally able to provide
            a meaningful and streamlined learning and growth experience to each
            member. Throughout the recruitment process, we look for the
            following criteria:

            Frequently Asked Questions
          </h2>
          <h3 className="font-bptext text-[22px] font-medium mb-[5px]">
            What is Blueprint&apos;s structure?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-dark-gray/70 text-[18px] mb-[40px]">
            Blueprint&apos;s project structure consists of 5 project teams, each
            with a Project Leader, a designer, and 4-5 developers. Each project
            team is dedicated to one of our nonprofit and community partners and
            works closely with our points of contact to create equitable
            solutions through design and development. <br />
            <br /> Blueprintâ€™s External team consists of 6 directors and the
            External Vice President as the team lead. External works to inspire
            students outside of Cal Blueprint about creating change in
            communities and promoting public welfare through tech and design.
            This is done through public events, partnerships with
            mission-aligned organizations, new programs, and more. External,
            along with other project teams, are supported by an executive team
            of 7 students.

          <h3 className="font-bptext text-[22px] font-medium mb-[5px]">
            What are nonprofit and community partner relationships like?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-dark-gray/70 text-[18px] mb-[40px]">
            Our partners each have dedicated internal point(s) of contact who
            meet with our project teams on a regular (weekly or bi-weekly)
            basis. Because interactions vary based on partner capacity,
            timezones, internet access, and more, it&apos;s important to note
            that each partner relationship looks a little different. Broadly
            speaking, these meetings help ensure that our partners are on the
            same page as our project teams, and that the solutions we design and
            develop will actually be able to help the partner and communities in
            the best possible ways. <br />
            <br /> At a more detailed level, we hold project scoping meeting(s)
            with each partner and their Project Leader at the start of the Fall
            semester to create a clear path for Blueprint is able to deliver. At
            the end of each semester, we hold a final meeting to present what
            was accomplished during the semester (and, in the case of fall, what
            will be accomplished in the spring).
          </p>

            What resources does Blueprint have to ensure success?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-dark-gray/70 text-[18px] mb-[40px]">
            Every member of Blueprint has several layers of formal support,
            including their project team members, their Project Leader, and the
            executive team. To keep a pulse check on how members are feeling,
            leadership actively seeks out constructive feedback and holds
            periodic one-on-ones with members. We also guide all new developers
            and designers through our technical onboarding processes and make
            sure there is always space to ask for help, no matter how large or
            small the task. Project Leaders and our External Vice Presidet also
            ensure project success through organized timelines that make tasks
            and expectations as clear as possible throughout the semester.{' '}
            <br />
            <br /> On top of everything, Blueprint is full of people who
            naturally want to help each other - on any given day or night,
            it&apos;s easy to find members squashing bugs together, holding
            informal critique sessions, DMing teammates for insight into other
            parts of Blueprint, or lending a listening ear. <br />
            <br /> Even beyond college, our extensive alumni network remains in
            touch and are often continuing to give back to Blueprint by sharing
            their post-graduation professional experiences.
